# Design Company Landing Page using Bootstrap and Jquery

## Background
I followed a tutorial from Debjani Paul in the iCode Newsletter-- [Building a Landing Page with Bootstrap and jQuery](http://icodemag.com/building-a-landing-page-with-bootstrap-and-jquery/). One of the new features that I worked is on the Bootstrap Carousel. It was pretty simple to code. I also added carat icons to the "preview" and "next" buttons and a "Back to the Top" button.
